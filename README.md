# Boilerplate repository for creating PHP Laravel and JS Vue NPM Packages

This boilderplate is ready to be published to Packagist and NPM JS.

## Usage

Simply fork this repository and customise. Search and Replace (case-sensitive) `Dewsign` and `NovaRepeaterBlocks` as well as `dewsign` and `nova-repeater-blocks` to get started.

## Publishing

Always use `npm version (major|minor|patch)` to publish new versions (even when working with PHP). This will automatically create the git tag for you which Packagist will then pick up for version publishing.
